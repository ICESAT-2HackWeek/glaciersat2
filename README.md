## Title: ICESat-2 over the Juneau Icefield

## Collaborators on this project

Ben Smith (data science co-lead)

We will explore ICESat-2 data over the JIF, compare to Arctic DEM. The general goal is to learn the tools for downloading
and interpreting ICESat-2 data. We will determine the potential of ICESAT-2 data to constrain surface processes, for example, 
dry vs wet snow. 

## Science Question

Work towards constraining the seasonality of elevation changes on glaciers and icefields, as more data become available.

## Potential data to explore 

Arctic DEM
GPS tracks on the icefield 
Optical imagery (Landsat, Sentinel 2, WV)
Weather station data
